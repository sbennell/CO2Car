## Race Operation Procedures

### Preparing for a Race
1. Power on the system
2. Wait for the blue LED to indicate the system is ready
3. Load the cars into the starting positions
4. Press the Car Loaded button
5. Wait for the green LED to indicate cars are loaded

### Starting a Race
1. Press the Start button
2. The system will perform a 3-second countdown with purple LED flashes
3. The starting gate will release automatically
4. The yellow LED will indicate the race is in progress

### During a Race
1. The system will automatically detect when cars cross the finish line
2. Real-time sensor data will be sent to the race management system
3. The first car to cross the finish line will be recorded

### After a Race
1. The system will determine the winner
2. The LED will flash the color of the winning car (red for car 1, green for car 2, blue for a tie)
3. Race results will be sent to the race management system
4. After 3 seconds, the system will automatically reset to the IDLE state

## Sensor Calibration

The system performs sensor calibration at startup and can be manually calibrated using the "calibrate" command.

### Automatic Calibration
1. The system takes 15 readings from each sensor
2. It calculates the average reading for each sensor
3. These baseline readings are used to detect when cars cross the finish line
4. The system indicates successful calibration with 3 green LED flashes
5. If calibration fails, the system indicates with 3 red LED flashes

### Manual Calibration
1. Send the "calibrate" command via serial
2. The system will perform the calibration procedure
3. Results will be sent via serial

### Calibration Threshold
- The system uses a 100mm threshold for car detection
- When a sensor reading drops below (baseline - 100mm), a car is considered to have crossed the finish line

## Race Management System Integration

The system communicates with the race management system using a JSON-based protocol over serial communication.

### Communication Protocol
- Baud rate: 115200
- Data format: JSON
- Line endings: Newline

### Message Types
1. **Status Messages**
   - Sent periodically and on state changes
   - Include current state, sensor readings, and race data

2. **Race Control Messages**
   - Received from the race management system
   - Control race operations (start, reset, calibrate)

3. **Race Result Messages**
   - Sent when a race is completed
   - Include timing data and winner information

4. **Sensor Data Messages**
   - Sent every 100ms during a race

### Integration Steps
1. Connect the ESP32 to the race management system via USB
2. Configure the race management system to communicate at 115200 baud
3. Implement the JSON protocol in the race management system
4. Test the integration with sample races
