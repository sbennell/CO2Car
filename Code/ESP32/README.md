# CO‚ÇÇ Car Race Timer

## Description

The **CO‚ÇÇ Car Race Timer** is an automated race timer system designed for CO‚ÇÇ-powered cars. It uses two VL53L0X distance sensors to measure the time taken for each car to cross the finish line. The system integrates a relay to trigger the CO‚ÇÇ firing mechanism and provides race results based on the fastest time. 

The system ensures that the race cannot start until both cars are loaded, which can be triggered by a button or serial command. Once the race starts, the system tracks each car's progress and declares the winner once both cars cross the finish line.

## Features

- **Two VL53L0X distance sensors**: Tracks the cars as they pass through the sensor line.
- **Relay control**: Fires the CO‚ÇÇ mechanism to start the race.
- **Load detection**: Requires cars to be loaded before the race can start, using a button or serial command.
- **Race result output**: Displays the time taken for each car to complete the race and declares a winner.
- **Button press handling**: Supports momentary switches for load and start buttons, with proper edge detection.
- **Debug logging**: Optionally outputs sensor distance readings for troubleshooting.
- **LED indicators**: Visual feedback of race state (waiting, ready, racing, finished).
- **Buzzer feedback**: Audible cues at race start and finish.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Two VL53L0X distance sensors**: Used to track the cars' progress through the track.
- **Relay module**: Triggers the CO‚ÇÇ firing mechanism.
- **Load button**: Used to signify when the cars are loaded.
- **Start button**: Used to start the race after the cars are loaded.
- **ESP32**: Manages communication between the sensors, relay, buttons, and the system logic.
- **Tri-color LED**: Visual indication of system state.
- **Buzzer**: Provides audible feedback for race events.

## Installation

### 1. Hardware Setup

- **VL53L0X Sensors**: Connect both sensors to the Arduino Uno via I2C (A4/SDA and A5/SCL pins). Use `XSHUT` pins (Digital 2 and Digital 3) to reset each sensor individually.
- **Relay Module**: Connect the relay to Digital 8 on the Arduino Uno to trigger the CO‚ÇÇ mechanism.
- **Buttons**: Connect the load button to Digital 4 and the start button to Digital 5.
- **LED**: Connect the tri-color LED to pins 10 (Red), 11 (Green), and 12 (Blue).
- **Buzzer**: Connect the buzzer to Digital 9.

### 2. Software Setup

1. **Install PlatformIO**: 
   - Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Install the PlatformIO extension

2. **Required Libraries**: The following libraries are automatically managed by PlatformIO:
   ```ini
   lib_deps =
     pololu/VL53L0X @ ^1.3.1
     bblanchon/ArduinoJson @ ^6.21.3
   ```

### 3. Upload Code to ESP32

1. Open the project in VS Code with PlatformIO
2. Connect your ESP32 via USB
3. Click the PlatformIO Upload button or use `pio run -t upload`

### 4. Monitor Serial Output

Open the PlatformIO Serial Monitor (115200 baud) using:
- Click the "Serial Monitor" button in PlatformIO
- Or use `pio device monitor`

## Usage

### 1. **Loading the Cars**
- **Via Load Button**: Press the **Load Button** (Digital 4) to signify that the cars are loaded and ready to race.
- **Via Serial Command**: Send **'L'** via Serial Monitor to load the cars.

Once the cars are loaded, the system will display a message indicating that the cars are ready to race, and the LED will show **amber** (red + green).

### 2. **Starting the Race**
- **Via Start Button**: Press the **Start Button** (Digital 5) to begin the race once the cars are loaded.
- **Via Serial Command**: Send **'S'** via Serial Monitor to start the race.

When the race starts, you'll hear a short beep and the LED will turn **blue**.

### 3. **Race Results**
Once both cars cross the finish line, the system will display the race results with the times for each car and declare the winner. You'll hear a longer beep and the LED will turn **green**.

Example output:
```
üö¶ Cars loaded. Press 'S' to start the race.
üì© Received Serial Command: S
üö¶ Race Starting...
üîπ Firing CO‚ÇÇ Relay...
‚úî Relay deactivated
üèé Race in progress...
üìè Sensor Readings: C1 = 145 mm, C2 = 130 mm
üèÅ Car 1 Finished! Time: 1234 ms
üèÅ Car 2 Finished! Time: 1120 ms
üéâ Race Finished!
üèÜ Car 2 Wins!
üìä RESULT: C1=1234ms, C2=1120ms
```

### 4. **Reset for Next Race**

After the race, the system will reset and wait for the next race. To reset:
- Press 'L' via Serial or press the Load Button to load the cars again.
- The LED will turn **red** when the system is waiting for cars to be loaded.

## LED Status Indicators

| Race State | LED Color    | Meaning                                     |
|------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Waiting    | Red          | System initialized, waiting for cars         |
| Ready      | Amber (R+G)  | Cars loaded, ready to start race            |
| Racing     | Blue         | Race in progress                            |
| Finished   | Green        | Race complete, results available            |

## Configuration

- **DEBUG Mode**: Set the `#define DEBUG` flag to true in the code to enable detailed debug logging of sensor readings.
- **Debounce Delay**: The `DEBOUNCE_DELAY` constant (default: 50ms) can be adjusted to fine-tune button responsiveness.
